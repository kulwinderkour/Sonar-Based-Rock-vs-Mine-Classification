Sonar-Based Rock vs Mine Classification
Project Overview

This project uses sonar signal data to classify underwater objects as rocks or mines. Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) works by emitting sound waves and analyzing their echoes to detect and locate objects. Using Logistic Regression, the model predicts object types accurately, aiding safe underwater navigation and mine detection.

Dataset

The dataset used is “Copy of sonar data.csv”.

It contains 208 samples with 60 features representing sonar signal strengths.

The target column indicates whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

Features

60 numerical features representing sonar readings.

Target column: R (Rock) or M (Mine).
